# Wheel of Fortune

## Idea
Wheel with default 18 sectors. After pressing the "Spin" button, the wheel spins 6 seconds - clockwise, and displays a prize.
 
## Functionality
* For 10 spins, the wheel stops 3 times on one sector and 2 times on a different one.

  * Calculates a new sector if the current sector is the same as the previous one, so it can display a new one.

* Hit the "Bonus" sector, the player receives 3 free spins. No need for interaction to start the spins.

  * The "Spin" button is locked during the "Free Spins"
  * Displays the total won by the player at the end of the spins and unlocks the "Spin" button
